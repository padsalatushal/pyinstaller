The deprecated ``PEP-302`` ``find_module()`` and ``load_module()``
methods have been removed from PyInstaller's ``FrozenImporter``. These
methods have not been used by python's import machinery since
python 3.4 and ``PEP-451``, and were effectively left untested and
unmaintained. The removal affects 3rd party code that still relies
on ``PEP-302`` finder/loader methods instead of the ``PEP-451`` ones.
